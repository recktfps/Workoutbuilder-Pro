## Launch Announcement Template

**Reddit Post (r/Fitness)**

*Title: [App] I built a workout tracker that actually looks good in 2026*

Hey r/Fitness,

I've been lifting for 8 years and tracking workouts for just as long. Every app I tried made me choose between functionality (Strong) or good design (Hevy, but with social bloat).

So I built WorkoutBuilder Pro – a tracker that's both powerful AND beautiful.

**What makes it different:**
- Dark mode with gradient-filled UI (actually looks premium)
- Progress charts that are motivating, not just functional
- All your data stays local (no account needed)
- Unlimited programs for serious lifters

It's free to try with a generous free tier. Pro is $50/year (50% less than Strong).

Available on iOS and Android: [link]

Would love your feedback!

**Good luck with the launch! 🚀💪**
