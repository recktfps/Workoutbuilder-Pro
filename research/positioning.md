## Positioning Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: "Too niche"
**Concern**: Targeting serious lifters limits TAM

**Mitigation**:
- Secondary audience (aspiring lifters) expands market
- Free tier captures casual users who may convert
- Serious lifters have highest LTV and lowest churn

### Risk 2: "Design over substance"
**Concern**: May be perceived as "pretty but shallow"

**Mitigation**:
- Free tier demonstrates depth immediately
- Technical documentation shows serious engineering
- User testimonials emphasize both beauty AND power

### Risk 3: "Competitors will copy"
**Concern**: Strong or Hevy updates UI to match

**Mitigation**:
- Design is hard to copy well (takes time and resources)
- We have 12-18 month head start
- Continuous design evolution keeps us ahead
- Brand association ("the beautiful one") sticky once established
